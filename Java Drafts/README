Created classes for every object because I think it allows for more flexibility. We can decide later if the class is necessary or not.
Added a few functions to some of the classes as well. 
I used Brandon's files as well and added a few functions.
My files don't have to be used, but I just wanted to provide a sort of template so we can start coding. We can discuss later how to proceed as well.
